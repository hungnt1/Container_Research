## StatefulSet

- StatefulSet các cách cung cấp các định danh duy nhất cho các Pod, được sử dụng trong deployment hoặc scale

- StatefullSet được sử dụng để giải quyết vấn đề stateful service và các kịch bản ứng dụng của nó

  - Stable persistent storage, that is, Pod can still access the same persistent data after rescheduling, based on PVC
  - Stable network sign, that is, PodName and HostName remain unchanged after Pod rescheduling, based on Headless Service (that is, Service without Cluster IP)
  - Ordered deployment, orderly expansion, that is, Pods are in order, and must be carried out in sequence according to the defined order when deploying or expanding (that is, from 0 to N-1, all previous Pods must be before the next Pod runs) Running and Ready status), based on init containers
  - Orderly shrink, orderly delete (ie from N-1 to 0)

- It can be found from the application scenario above that the StatefulSet consists of the following parts:

  - Headless Service for defining network logo (DNS domain)
  - VolumeClaimTemplates for creating PersistentVolumes
  - Define StatefulSet for specific applications
  - The DNS format of each Pod in the StatefulSet is statefulSetName-{0..N-1}.serviceName.namespace.svc.cluster.local, where

- serviceNameName for Headless Service
  - 0..N-1The serial number where the Pod is located, starting from 0 to N-1
  - statefulSetNameName of StatefulSet
  - namespaceFor the namespace where the service is located, Headless Servic and StatefulSet must be in the same namespace
  - .cluster.localFor Cluster Domain
